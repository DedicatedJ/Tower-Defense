# Lua Coding Standards
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class-like tables (e.g., Enemy, Turret).
- Avoid global variables; use local variables or modules.
- Follow LÃ–VE's coding style guidelines (e.g., `love.update`, `love.draw`).

# Game-Specific Guidelines
- **Pathfinding**: Use Jumper for grid-based pathfinding to ensure enemies navigate the map logically.
- **Collision Detection**: Use Bump.lua for efficient AABB collision handling between entities like projectiles and enemies.
- **Map Handling**: Use STI (Simple Tiled Implementation) to load and render maps created in Tiled, with custom layers for interactive elements.
- **State Management**: Utilize HUMP's gamestate library to manage game states (e.g., menu, gameplay, pause) and timer library for wave scheduling.
- **UI Development**: Use LoveFrames or SUITE for creating user interfaces like health bars, turret placement menus, and wave indicators.

# AI Behavior
- Suggest Jumper's A* algorithm for enemy pathfinding across grids.
- Recommend using Bump.lua's collision detection for projectile-enemy interactions.
- Load maps dynamically using STI and provide examples of integrating Tiled layers with game logic.
- Use HUMP's timer library for scheduling enemy waves and gamestate transitions.
- Provide examples of creating UI elements such as buttons, sliders, and panels using LoveFrames.

# Optimization Guidelines
- Implement object pooling for frequently created entities like projectiles or enemies to reduce memory allocation overhead.
- Use quadtree or spatial partitioning techniques to optimize collision checks for large numbers of enemies and towers.
- Profile game performance regularly to identify bottlenecks in rendering or logic execution.

# Deprecated Patterns
- Do not use blocking functions like `os.execute()` or infinite loops without proper exit conditions.
- Avoid hardcoding values; use configuration tables instead.

# File Patterns
- Apply these rules to *.lua files in the project directory.
- Follow a consistent directory structure:
  - `/systems/` - Core game systems (enemies, towers, heroes, etc.)
  - `/states/` - Game states using HUMP's gamestate
  - `/libs/` - External libraries (hump, bump, class, json)
  - `/utils/` - Utility functions and modules
  - `/assets/` - Game assets (levels, sprites, sounds)
  - `/sprites/` - Organized by entity type (towers/, enemies/, projectiles/)
- Use module pattern in all files:
  - Each file should return a single table/function
  - Keep imports at the top of the file
  - Order imports: core libraries first, then project modules
- When a required library is missing:
  - Implement fallback functionality when possible (like the Pathfinder in enemy.lua)
  - Add clear error handling and user feedback
- Document public API functions with brief descriptions of parameters and return values
- For sprite assets that may be missing, implement default renderers like createDefaultSprite
